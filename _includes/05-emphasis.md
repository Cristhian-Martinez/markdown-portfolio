I am **very good** at catching *freesbees* in the air, especially _unexpected_ freesbees coming from nowhere. It happens to me very often, I am like a freesbee _**magnet**_ :magnet:. Something similar happens with boomerangs but less often, sometimes I am at the movies, or simply getting bubble gum flavored ice cream in the street, and literary **out of the blue**, a *boomerang* that I threw years ago returns to me, and of course I **have to** catch it. I also know how to code using `install.packages ("tidyverse")`, `library(tidyverse)`.
